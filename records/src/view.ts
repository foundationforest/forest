// The view: what a profile's folder says, from whatever records a reader holds, at the reader's
// clock. A pure function of the set of records: where they came from and in what order does not
// matter, so two readers holding the same records agree.
//
// Rules:
//   1. Records dated more than MAX_FUTURE_MS ahead of the reader's clock are held back.
//   2. `hosts` and `permissions` are the owner's alone (the shape check refuses an access key
//      there). The newest is current.
//   3. At a content path, if the owner ever wrote there, the owner's newest version is current and
//      no access key's record counts. Otherwise the newest access key's record the current
//      permissions record allows: its key is listed with scope write, or was write, and its paths
//      cover the record's path (with no paths, every content path but those `profile` covers).
//      A past write key is still listed, so what it wrote still counts; a past message key never
//      counts; a key whose entry is gone counts for nothing. No date is checked: when a record
//      arrived is the host's check, and a host takes nothing from a past key.
//   4. Newest: the later time, then the larger id. A null body is a delete.
