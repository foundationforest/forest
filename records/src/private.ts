// Private records: a body only chosen keys open. The body on a host is
// `{ private: <age file, base64url> }`. The age file is the envelope: one random file key per
// record, sealed once to each key, naming none of them. Each key is age's post-quantum hybrid
// (mlkem768x25519: ML-KEM-768 with X25519); its public half is `age1pq1…`. The keys are read keys
// the owner's app makes, one for each reader, and usually the owner's own inbox key, which keys/
// mixes from the main key and the profile record's `inboxKey` field publishes. The record around
// the envelope is signed as usual, so no reader can forge content for the others.
//
// What this does not hide: that a private record exists, its path, time and size, and how many
// keys it was made for (one stanza each). Removing a reader means a new version made for the rest;
// a reader keeps whatever it already opened. No forward secrecy: a key that leaks later opens every
// envelope ever made for it.
//
// A message's body is one of these envelopes, made for the recipient's inbox key and its inbox's
// readers, or for the inbox key alone when it holds a grant. message() seals and signs one;
// openMessage() checks one and opens it. The notes on the keys a person handed out ride in their
// permissions record, made for their own inbox key alone. The vault, what a new device needs and
// the seed cannot give back, the grants a person received among it, is one private record at
// `vault` in a folder of its own, made for the vault's own inbox key alone (vault.ts).
