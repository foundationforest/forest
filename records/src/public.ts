// Reaching a host a stranger named, and only on the public internet. A host that reads a sender's
// records, or an app that follows a profile's hosts record, goes to an origin someone else chose:
// one that may lead into the reader's own network, a cloud's metadata service, or a machine behind
// a router. publicFetch refuses all of those before anything is sent, and follows no redirect, so
// a public host cannot hand the request on to a private one. Services' host and the CLI share this
// copy.

// Node only: it uses undici and Node's DNS. Everything else in records runs in a browser too.
