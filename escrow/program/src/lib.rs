// ============================================================
// Program:    Forest escrow
// Framework:  Anchor 1.2
// Testing:    LiteSVM
// Risk level: Medium by the safe-solana-builder table; treated as Critical, because it is
//             sealed at deploy and holds other people's money
// Template:   Frank Castle's safe-solana-builder
// Security:   see escrow/security-checklist.md
// ============================================================

//! The Forest escrow.
//!
//! Money in, and out only when the two sides agree. One shape. An amount of a token held between
//! two keys, buyer and seller. The token is any mint of the classic SPL Token program or of
//! Token-2022, but for wrapped SOL and a Token-2022 mint with a transfer fee or that cannot be
//! transferred. Each escrow has its own deposit account, funded by a
//! plain transfer from anywhere; the escrow counts as funded when that account holds at least the
//! agreed amount. Once funded it has three ways out: the buyer releases everything to the
//! seller, the seller releases everything to the buyer, or both sign a split. Receiving in full
//! never needs the receiver's signature, so each side alone can give, and only together can they
//! divide. Every way out pays out the whole balance, whatever it is.
//!
//! Two options, each off unless the creator turns it on at creation: an arbiter key that may sign
//! any split, and a timer that, a number of days after the funding is marked, lets anyone send
//! everything to the side it names. There is no other clock.
//!
//! Either party may object, once per escrow, at any time before the timer is due. After an
//! objection the timer never runs: the money moves only by the parties agreeing (a release or a
//! split) or by the arbiter, if one was named. The receipt records who objected and when.
//!
//! When an escrow ends, its deposit account closes and the escrow account stays, with the outcome
//! and the amounts in it: its address is a permanent receipt, and never holds a second deal. The
//! receipt records when the money was there (the mark, or else the ending) and when it ended.
//! Money paid to it after the end goes back to the buyer, and rent above the minimum goes back to
//! the payer who fronted it; neither changes the receipt. An escrow that never held the amount is
//! closed instead, both accounts and both rents.
//!
//! The escrow's address comes from the creator's key and an id, and the creator signs: nobody can
//! open an escrow at an address another key will use. Each party is paid only at its standard
//! token account for the mint. The deposit account's rent, and both rents of a closed escrow, go
//! to the creator, whoever fronted them; only rent above the receipt's minimum goes to the payer.
//!
//! Every payment out is a `transfer_checked` under the mint's own token program, carrying the
//! transaction's remaining accounts: whatever a transfer hook the mint names needs, which the
//! client resolves. They reach the token program without any signature. What a mint's issuer can
//! do (freeze, pause, a permanent delegate, a hook that refuses) is the issuer's, not the
//! program's: `escrow/README.md` lists it.
//!
//! This program is sealed per version. The upgrade authority is removed at deploy, so nothing
//! here can be patched: read `escrow/README.md` for what is sealed and what the app decides.
//! There is no admin, no config account, no pause and no fee. v1, an earlier program no longer in
//! this repo, stays at its own address; each escrow follows the program it was opened in.
//!
//! Nothing is shipped.
