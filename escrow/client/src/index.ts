// The Forest escrow client, v2: build every instruction, build an escrow's terms from a post's
// terms and the deal's own choices, show a person any option they did not set before they work or
// pay, tell when a timer is due and whether an objection can still land, and decode the escrow
// account and its events. It talks to no network of its own: the caller reads accounts and sends
// transactions. The pay link's format is in `escrow/README.md`; the app reads it.
//
// Nothing here is shipped.
